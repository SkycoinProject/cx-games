PacMan CX 3D is a simple 3D game powered by the CX programming language.
This game is being developed with the following objectives:

  - Demonstrate the capabilities of CX
  - Obtain feedback on the language
  - Increase awareness for the Skycoin Project (developers of CX)

# What is CX?
CX is a general purpose, interpreted and compiled programming language, with a very strict type system and a syntax similar to Golang's. CX provides a new programming paradigm based on the concept of affordances, where the user can ask the programming language at runtime what can be done with a CX object (functions, expressions, packages, etc.), and interactively or automatically choose one of the affordances to be applied.
