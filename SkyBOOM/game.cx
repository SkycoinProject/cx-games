--------------- ISSUE REPORTS ----------------------------------------
passing parameter to entities.Update () had no proper error 




printf() can have more arguments than there is %codes for 




len() should give an error message when used on non-collection vars 




i seem to be having a problem with remove() not being able to selectively remove 1 item from a slice within a slice of slices.  just wondering if you ever do that @d2bug

it seems to remove all of them instead of just the 1.

entities.All[FALLING_COIN] = remove(entities.All[FALLING_COIN], i)

actually it seems to remove all items the 1st time or 2, then after that it leaves 1 (out of around 7 items) remaining in the inner slice.




hmmmm, it seems i can't get the correct values out of a struct which was returned by a function from a package.  i guess all the values i retrieve from a package have to be basic types.

func Get (entType i32, id i32) (e Entity) {
  e = All[entType][id]
  printf("INSIDE Get() All[entType][id].y: %f \n", All[entType][id].y)
  printf("INSIDE Get()                e.y: %f \n", e.y)
}

that's INSIDE the package, and even INSIDE, "e" has default values instead of what i had just set it to.

(the All[entType][id].y has the values i expected)
