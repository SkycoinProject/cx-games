# CXtris 

Make sure you have this entire subfolder (of the "cx-games" repo) on your hard drive.  Also it's name must be exactly "CXtris".
Then run it with the command "cx .", from the main folder of the game.
This assumes you copied the CX.EXE file there, or that you have it in your path (environment variable).  Otherwise you need to supply the path (to CX) on the command line:
("[___your_PATH_goes_here___]\cx .")


The file with the version of CX.EXE that is most certain to work is:
(cx-0.7.0-bin-[___your_OS_goes_here___]-x64.zip)


It can be downloaded at the bottom of this webpage: https://github.com/skycoin/cx/releases/tag/v0.7.0



# Note
After deleting the 2 abandoned, non-functional Tetris-clone folders, I went back in the repo history to see what kind of textures the game had.  After looking at the textures, I started thinking about the logic involved in this kind of game, and thought it might be fairly easy to write (from scratch) without taking too much time.
