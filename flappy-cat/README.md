Flappy Cat is a clone to the popular game FlappyBird written in cx.

# What is CX?
CX is a general purpose, interpreted and compiled programming language, with a very strict type system and a syntax similar to Golang's. CX provides a new programming paradigm based on the concept of affordances, where the user can ask the programming language at runtime what can be done with a CX object (functions, expressions, packages, etc.), and interactively or automatically choose one of the affordances to be applied.

You can find more info on:
  - The github page on CX - https://github.com/SkycoinProject/cx
  - The official website of Skycoin - https://www.skycoin.com/
